    Hey, I'm Ashutosh! I'm a frontend web developer from Bangladesh. I'm a life long learner. I'm enthusiastic about web, math, open source, linux and vim. Fun fact: even in the age of VSCode I choosed to live in the terminal with vim(I mean neovim).
  </p>

  <p>
  I wrote my first lines of JavaScript back in 2011. I wrote simple programs like making odd magic squares and finding <i>n</i>th root of a number. Next 9 years I did programming but that was occasional. I did several small to medium sized projects to make my life easier. I mainly pursued to different directions, including becoming a portrait artist and 3d artist. I was not sure what I want to become. As a result I droped out of college several times. Finally I stopped pursing academic education altogether. Life is small, I don't want to fill it with things that I will never use except exams.

  <p>
  At the start of 2020, I realized, I want to be a programmer and web developer. From then I never looked back. I self learned and gave a deep dive into JavaScript programming fundamentals and CSS core concepts.

  On 1 Jan, 2021, I started the Complete Web Development Course by Jhankar Mahhub to prepare myself for getting a Job. I've completed the main course successfully and now continuing the special SCIC program which they offer only to students who have earned good average marks.
